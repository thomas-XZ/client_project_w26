                <h2>Why Networking and Communication Matter</h2>
                <p>
                    Making connections isn't just for social butterflies — it's
                    vital for academic, professional, and
                    personal growth. Effective communication helps you stand out
                    and make a lasting impression, while
                    networking opens doors to opportunities you might not even
                    know exist!
                </p>
                <p>
                    UMSI students are future-focused: tomorrow's competitive
                    Data Analysts, distinguished UI Designers, and
                    skilled Librarians. But before you can truly excel in these
                    fields, there's a universal foundation to
                    build — outstanding networking and communication skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter your chosen path in the information sciences, your
                    technical talents alone won't carry you
                    over
                    the finish line; your ability to connect with others, share
                    ideas clearly, and cultivate meaningful
                    professional relationships is just as crucial. Networking
                    isn't only for job hunting — it's how you find
                    mentors, discover hidden opportunities, and collaborate on
                    innovative projects that set you apart from
                    the crowd.</p>

                <h2>How to Start Networking (Even If You're Shy!)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attend Events:</strong> Go to campus meetups,
                        workshops, or department gatherings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Online Platforms:</strong> Connect with
                        peers and professionals on LinkedIn, Slack, or
                        U-M’s own tools like Maizey and Go Blue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find Common Ground:</strong> Start conversations
                        about classes, shared interests, or campus
                        news — pizza is almost always a safe topic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask for Advice:</strong> People enjoy sharing
                        their experiences. "What led you to your
                        major/job?" is a great icebreaker.

                    <li>
                        <strong>How long should my resume be?</strong><br>
                        For most UMSI students and new grads, one page is best.
                        More experienced professionals may require
                        two pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do I need a different resume for each
                            application?</strong><br>
                        It’s wise to tailor your resume to the requirements and
                        keywords of each opportunity.

                        <strong>Is it okay to include coursework or student
                            projects?</strong><br>
                        Absolutely! UMSI coursework and projects are valued by
                        employers, especially if they show relevant
                        skills and
                        impact.

                            resume?</strong><br>
                        Update your resume every semester, after major projects,
                        or whenever you gain a new role or
                        responsibility.

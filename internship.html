                <h2>What is an Internship?</h2>
                <p>
                    Internships are pivotal experiences for UMSI students,
                    providing real-world learning, professional connections, and
                    a chance to apply classroom knowledge in diverse information
                    environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re interested in user experience,
                    data analysis, library science, or information policy,
                    landing an internship can help launch your career and
                    clarify your professional goals. UMSI encourages students to
                    start early and use every available resource — including
                    personalized support, digital tools, and extensive campus
                    networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While UMSI students are well-trained candidates for
                    employers, you may still need some special techniques to
                    help you find internships successfully!

                <h2>Tips for a Successful Internship Search</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start Early:</strong>
                        Begin your search several months in advance. Many summer
                        internships recruit during the fall semester!</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflect on Your Goals:</strong> What skills do
                        you want to develop? What kinds of organizations
                        interest you? Define your priorities before starting
                        your search.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customize Your Application Materials:</strong>
                        Always tailor your resume and cover letter for each
                        position. Highlight class projects, leadership roles,
                        and technical skills relevant to the internship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailor for Each Opportunity:</strong> Customize
                        your resume for every job or internship you
                        pursue.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Track application
                        deadlines, requirements, and communication with
                        employers. Use a simple spreadsheet or task
                        manager.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Send thank you notes after
                        interviews. This keeps you on the employer’s radar and
                        demonstrates professionalism.</li>
